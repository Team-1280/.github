Hi there 👋
# Team 1280 - The Ragin’ C-Biscuits

## Welcome to the Home of Team 1280 - The Ragin’ C-Biscuits! 🤖🚀

### 🏫 About Us
We are the FIRST Robotics Team of San Ramon Valley High School (SRVHS), also known as "The Ragin’ C-Biscuits." Founded in 2003, our team hails from Danville, San Ramon, and Alamo, California. Initially a class, we've evolved into a dynamic club, participating in the ultimate Sport for the Mind - the FIRST Robotics Competition.

### 🤖 Our Mission
Our mission is to ignite the spark of curiosity and innovation in our students. We focus on hands-on training in technical skills, leadership development, and fostering a spirit of lifelong learning. Every member of our team is a vital part of the C-Biscuit Family, where teaching and exploration go hand-in-hand.

### 🏆 Achievements
- **Founded:** 2003
- **First Worlds Participation:** 2008
- **Awards:** Over 30, including Monterey Regional Champs, Rookie Inspiration Award, Rockwell Automation Innovation in Control Award, and more.
- **Special Projects:**
  - Bozo Autonomous, an R&D project mapping the SRVHS parking lot in an unpredictable yet effective manner.
  - Jankboard, a custom fully featured replacement for Shuffleboard, presenting data in a much friendlier fashion and providing an extensible API for developing custom features.
  - DeepBozo, the AI powered autonomous suite, consisting of:
    - Our proprietary computer vision project BozoVision, powering our revolutionary BozoVision Occupancy Network and providing data for other autonomous subroutines.
    - Our advanced safety and driver assistance suite BozoAssist (with features such as adaptive cruise control, crash mitigation via BozoVision and the Occupancy Network, and emergency AI intervention via BozoLLM)
    - BozoLLM, our custom tuned Llava-based large language model that provides additional input and data for BozoVision, as well as smart decision making.  
    - BozoAimbot, custom technology that automatically aligns our robot with selected targets with the help of BozoVision
  - BozoAuto Mk. II, the new pre-planned path autonomous subroutine assisted by DeepBozo and BozoLLM in unplanned situations

### 💻 Our Philosophy
"Innovation and creativity drive us forward." We believe in the power of 'it ain’t stupid if it works' – a philosophy that guides both our robotics designs and our approach to problem-solving. We cherish our friendly rivalry with Team 1458 Red Tie Robotics and our friendship with Team 852 Athenian Robotics Collective.
